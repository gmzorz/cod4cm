## Client Manager for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

This script was inspired by Sam Hopkins' method of setting up players for faked clips.

Running multiple CoD4 windows at once and letting them connect to the local host. This script eases the workflow and even has a built-in updater. Default mod to setup clips will be downloaded upon first launch. 

### Installing and running:

Extract [clman.bat](https://github.com/gmzorz/cod4cm/blob/master/clman.bat), [clman.cfg](https://github.com/gmzorz/cod4cm/blob/master/clman.cfg) and [version.cmd](https://github.com/gmzorz/cod4cm/blob/master/version.cmd) into the cod4 directory. **Always run clman.bat as Administrator**, check clman.cfg for more options
